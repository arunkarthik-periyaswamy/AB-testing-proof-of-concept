# AB-testing-proof-of-concept

A/B testing is like a scientific experiment for your website or app. It helps you compare two versions to see which one performs better. Inspired by a project from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257), this repository will showcase a proof of concept for A/B testing, demonstrating how to design an experiment, analyze data, and draw meaningful conclusions.
